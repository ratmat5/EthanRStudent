### Before the quiz
- Before taking the college board quiz, I reviewed all of the python lessons in the student teaching, as well as reviewing some college board videos.

### During the quiz
- When taking the quiz, there were a lot of topics that I was not familiar with or struggled with, so when these topics popped up, I used google or ChatGPT to learn about what those things were to get a better understanding of it. After that, I made my best guess with my new learned knowledge.
