### Reflection
- Learned how to use html
- Learned a lot about python and the many functions it can use
- Created my own personal blog on github
- Applied roles of scrum master, frontend, and backend devs to our team
- Learned how to implement APIs and the connection to the frontend
- How to utilize and navigate VSCode

### Future plans
- I want to do more projects that involve using apis in the backend, to be able to understand how to connect them to the frontend better
- I want to able to get better with python code, as it is one of the main programs that we will use
