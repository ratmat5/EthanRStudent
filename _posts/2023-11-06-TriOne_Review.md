### Reflection
- Learned how to use html
- Learned a lot about python and the many functions it can use
- Created my own personal blog on github
- Applied roles of scrum master, frontend, and backend devs to our team
- Learned how to implement APIs and the connection to the frontend
- How to utilize and navigate VSCode
- Summary: At the start of this class, I was very frustrated as I didn't have a good computer, and once finally getting my computer was behind. I struggled with setting up things like hombrew, python, juypter, and my repo. That was a very stressful first and second week for me, but fortunately once I figured everything out with the help of peers and problem-solving. That was probably the most relieved and happy I have felt in this past trimester. In general, I think that this class has helped me with collaboration and preblem solving. First, collaboration is very important and it simulates a real life team experience in jobs. This also ties into problem-solving, as asking your teammates is one of the best ways to solve a problem. In conclusion, I learned many useful skills and coding skills this trimester, and hope to become better.

### Future plans
- I want to do more projects that involve using apis in the backend, to be able to understand how to connect them to the frontend better
- I want to able to get better with python code, as it is one of the main programs that we will use
- Possibly learn a new language, but continue improving on the ones we have already gone over.
