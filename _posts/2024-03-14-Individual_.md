### Key Commits
https://github.com/rayanesouuuu1234/cpt_frontend/commit/9b78f96a908d6ed9504568f06776205adfb7b720
- This allows the flag game to have an option to view the list of all the flags that are used in the game

### Reflection
- I should get a 90% seed because I got a 91% last trimester, I have code, push and pull commits, and I participated and corrected all of the college board quizzes.
